## About this project

This is a sequel to a game I made in one month (~60 hours) ported over from Unity to Godot 4.1.1. While the original was a sort of self imposed month long game jam this game is being worked on at a much slower pace with only a loose estimated release date of end of January 2024.

The plan is also to collaborate with more creators on this project to create an overall similar but much more polished experience compared to the first game, including most if not all features I had to cut due to the 1 month deadline (with an all new story and setting of course).

## Usage / Project Contribution

This project is currently listed under CC0 and can thus be used freely for any purpose without the need for attribution. My intent is to keep it this way through release, however some third party assets may eventually be used that will require crediting the creator. If this becomes the case I will organize said resources appropriately and leave instructions on which assets require attribution.

## How to play the game

There is currently no build or store page created for the game, but the game will be freely available under a new page on my itch when it's released: https://mrgoonandwatch.itch.io/

Alternatively you can clone this repository and build/run the game yourself. It's recommended to use Godot v4.1.1 as that's what I've built the game on and I haven't tested other version, but whichever version you try you'll need the .NET build as the scripts are entirely in C#. I can also say with high confidence Godot 3.x or earlier will likely not work due to some massive engine changes between these major versions.

Long term I would like to upgrade this project to the latest stable 4.x version of Godot but at the time of writing this I have no experience upgrading Godot projects across version numbers so if it proves to be too troublesome I may abandon it.
